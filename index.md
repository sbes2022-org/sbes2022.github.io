# SBES 2022
### 36th Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering

## Call for Papers â€“ Research Track

The Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES), annually promoted by the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC), 
is the premier Software Engineering conference in Latin America. 

The SBES Research Track is the main track of the symposium and it publishes solid, 
well-evaluated contributions to the state-of-the-art in the area of Software Engineering. 
Papers in this track are reviewed based on originality, relevance, technical soundness, and clarity of presentation. 
The symposium proceedings will be published in the ACM Digital Library.

## Important Dates

TBD.

## Topics of Interest

TBD.

## Paper Preparation, Submission, and Review

Papers can be submitted in Portuguese or English. Submission in English is strongly encouraged. 
The acceptance of a paper implies that at least one of its authors will register at CBSoft 2022 to present it. 
All submissions must be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and must comply with the ACM 2-column conference format ([ACM_SigConf](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)). 

LaTeX users must use the ```acmart.cls``` class provided in the template with the conference format enabled at the document preamble:

```\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}```

Authors must use the ACM-Reference-Format.bst bibliography style also provided in the template:

```\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}```

Submissions must be no longer than 10 pages, including all figures and references.

Papers should be electronically submitted through JEMS. 
All technical research papers should indicate after the abstract the language and one or more of the aforementioned categories. 
Submissions that are not in compliance with the required submission format, are out of the scope of the symposium, or were submitted or published in any other forum (conference or journal) will be rejected without review. 
All other papers will be reviewed by at least three Program Committee members. 
During the review process, a rebuttal may be requested. 
In this case, authors will have access to reviews and may argue and answer questions from the referees before the final acceptance/rejection decision. 
The rebuttal is limited to a plain text up to 5,000 characters (including spaces).

## Double-Blind Submission

The SBES 2022 Research Track will follow a double-blind review process. 
All submitted papers should conceal the identity of the authors. 
Both author names and affiliations must be omitted. In addition, the following rules should be addressed:

+ Citations to own related work must be written in the third person. For example, one must write "the previous work of Silva et al." as opposed to "our previous work." As a heuristic, occurrences of "we", "our", "ours", "github", "funding", etc. should be looked in the paper and removed prior to submitting.
+ In the submitted paper, any artifact in a repository or website that allows identifying the authorship should not be mentioned. If any artifact needs to be made available, it should be anonymized in the repository/website (see Anonymous).
+ Reviewers will not be encouraged to look for references that identify the authors in other sources on the Internet. Searches in digital libraries or existing artifacts do not break the double blind policy.
+ If the submitted paper is a follow up of a previous work, the reference may be anonymized in the submitted paper. For example, "the previous work of Silva et al." can be adapted to "based on the previous work [X]" and the reference at the end of the paper can be presented as "[X] Anonymous authors. Not presented due to double blind review.".

After the paper acceptance, all the paper information (without anonymization) can be included in the camera-ready version.
Any questions about the preparation of the paper following the double-blind rules can be sent to the Program Committee Chairs.

## Best Paper Award

Every year, the SBES Steering Committee appoints a committee to award the symposium's best papers. 
Awarded papers of the Research Track are announced during the conference. 
The five best papers of the Research Track will be invited to submit an extended version in English to the research category of JSERD.

## Outstanding Reviewer Award

SBES 2022 acknowledges the generosity of the reviewers who give their time and best effort to referee submitted papers. 
The progress of scientific growth depends on dedicated colleagues, who aim to further the development of technology by offering their attention and passion when reviewing the papers. A certificate of Outstanding Reviewer will be awarded to reviewers who submitted outstanding quality reviews to SBES. The evaluation will be based on the quality and usefulness of reviews, as well as participation during PC discussion.
