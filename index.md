# SBES 2022
### 36th Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering
   September XX, 2022 
   Uberlândia, Minas Gerais

## Call for Papers – Research Track

The Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES), annually promoted by the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC), 
is the premier Software Engineering conference in Latin America. 

The SBES Research Track is the main track of the symposium and it publishes solid, 
well-evaluated contributions to the state-of-the-art in the area of Software Engineering. 
Papers in this track are reviewed based on originality, relevance, technical soundness, and clarity of presentation. 
The symposium proceedings will be published in the ACM Digital Library.

## Important Dates

* Paper registration (abstract submission): TBD.
* Paper submission: TBD.
* Rebuttal period: TBD.
* Author notification: TBD.
* Camera-ready: TBD.

The acceptance of a paper implies that at least one of its authors will register at CBSoft 2022 to present it. 

## Topics of Interest

TBD.

## Paper Preparation

Papers can be submitted in Portuguese or English. Submission in English is strongly encouraged. 
All submissions must be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and must comply with the ACM 2-column conference format ([ACM_SigConf](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)). 

LaTeX users must use the ```acmart.cls``` class provided in the template with the conference format enabled at the document preamble:

```\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}```

Authors must use the ACM-Reference-Format.bst bibliography style also provided in the template:

```\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}```

Submissions must be no longer than 10 pages, including all figures and references.

## Submission

Papers should be electronically submitted through JEMS. 
All technical research papers should indicate after the abstract the language and one or more of the aforementioned categories. 
Submissions that are not in compliance with the required submission format, are out of the scope of the symposium, 
or were submitted or published in any other forum (conference or journal) will be rejected without review. 

## Double-Blind Submission

The SBES 2022 Research Track will follow a double-blind review process. 
All submitted papers should conceal the identity of the authors. 
Both author names and affiliations must be omitted. In addition, the following rules should be addressed:

+ Citations to own related work must be written in the third person. For example, one must write "the previous work of Silva et al." as opposed to "our previous work." As a heuristic, occurrences of "we", "our", "ours", "github", "funding", etc. should be looked in the paper and removed prior to submitting.
+ In the submitted paper, any artifact in a repository or website that allows identifying the authorship should not be mentioned. If any artifact needs to be made available, it should be anonymized in the repository/website (see Anonymous).
+ Reviewers will not be encouraged to look for references that identify the authors in other sources on the Internet. Searches in digital libraries or existing artifacts do not break the double blind policy.
+ If the submitted paper is a follow up of a previous work, the reference may be anonymized in the submitted paper. For example, "the previous work of Silva et al." can be adapted to "based on the previous work [X]" and the reference at the end of the paper can be presented as "[X] Anonymous authors. Not presented due to double blind review.".

After the paper acceptance, all the paper information (without anonymization) can be included in the camera-ready version.
Any questions about the preparation of the paper following the double-blind rules can be sent to the Program Committee Chairs.

## Review Criteria

Original papers in the Research track will be reviewed by at least three Program Committee members, based on their
originality, relevance, technical soundness, and clarity of presentation. 

+ Originality
+ Relevance
+ Technical Soundnenss
+ Presentation
+ Transparency

The acceptance of a paper implies that at least one of its authors will register at CBSoft 2022 to present it. 

## Rebuttal

During the review process, a rebuttal may be requested. 
In this case, authors will have access to reviews and may argue and answer questions 
from the referees before the final acceptance/rejection decision. 
The rebuttal is limited to a plain text up to 5,000 characters (including spaces).

## Open Science Policies

The research track of ICSE 2022 is governed by the SBES 2022 Open Science policies. 
In summary, the steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public and,
if possible, empirical studies should be reproducible. 
In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and 
encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability. 
Note that sharing research data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance. 
However, sharing is expected to be the default, and non-sharing needs to be justified. 
We recognize that reproducibility or replicability is not a goal in qualitative research and that, 
similar to industrial studies, qualitative studies often face challenges in sharing research data. 

Upon acceptance, authors have the possibility to separately submit their supplementary material 
to the ICSE 2022 Artifact Evaluation track, for recognition of artifacts that are 
reusable, available, replicated or reproduced.

Any questions about the preparation of the paper following the SBES 2022 open science policies
can be sent to the Open Science Chair.

## Journal-First Submissions

SBES is partnering with international journals to incorporate journal-first papers into the SBES 2022 Research Track. 
Two journals, IEEE Software and the Journal of Software Engineering Research and Development (JSERD), 
have confirmed their partnership with SBES 20XX. 
Authors of journal-first papers accepted in those journals will be invited to present their research work at SBES. 
This offers an opportunity for authors to discuss their work with the community as well as enrich the technical program of SBES.

The following evaluation criteria will be used to select journal-first papers to SBES 2021:

- the paper describes original results that are not extensions of previous conference papers;
- the paper was accepted for publication in the journal no earlier than January 1, 2020; and
- the paper has not been presented at any other conference as a journal-first.

The selected papers will be presented in the technical program of the SBES Research Track. 
At least one author per selected journal-first paper will need to register at CBSoft 2022 
and attend the symposium to present it.

For journal-first papers published in JSERD, submissions of papers are accepted from the following categories: 
research articles, case studies, and reviews. 
For journal-first papers published in IEEE Software, only peer-reviewed research papers 
(not editorially-reviewed or invited papers) are accepted.

Authors interested in presenting journal-first papers at SBES 2022 should send an email 
to the Program Committee Chairs with the subject "Journal-First - SBES 2022" by June 28, 2022. 
The following information must be provided: (i) paper title; (ii) list of authors; 
(iii) link to the paper; and (iv) a short statement on how the work satisfies the criteria above.

## Best Paper Award

Every year, the SBES Steering Committee appoints a committee to award the symposium's best papers. 
Awarded papers of the Research Track are announced during the conference. 
The five best papers of the Research Track will be invited to submit an extended version in English to the research category of JSERD.

## Outstanding Reviewer Award

SBES 2022 acknowledges the generosity of the reviewers who give their time and best effort to referee submitted papers. 
The progress of scientific growth depends on dedicated colleagues, who aim to further the development of technology by offering their attention and passion when reviewing the papers. A certificate of Outstanding Reviewer will be awarded to reviewers who submitted outstanding quality reviews to SBES. The evaluation will be based on the quality and usefulness of reviews, as well as participation during PC discussion.
